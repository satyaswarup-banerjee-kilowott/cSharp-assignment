# MEAN, MEDIAN, MODE

## MEAN 
The mean (or average) is the most popular and well known measure of central tendency.It can be used with both discrete and continuous data, although its use is most often with continuous data.

How to find Mean?

Given n size unsorted array or list, its mean will be : 

Mean of an array = (sum of all elements) / (number of elements)


## MEDIAN
Median is the middle value of a set of data. To determine the median value in a sequence of numbers, the numbers must first be arranged in ascending order. 

If there is an odd amount of elements in the set of data, the formula for Median will be:

Median = N/2 (where N is the size if the dataset)

If there is an even amount of elements in the set of data, the formula for Median will be:

Median = ((N-1)/2 + N/2)/2) (where N is the size if the dataset)


## MODE
Mode is the value which occurs most frequently in a dataset.

For Example:
Input : array a[] = {1, 1, 1, 2, 7, 1}

Output : Mode = 1

Input : array a[] = {9, 9, 9, 9, 9}

Output : Mode = 9
